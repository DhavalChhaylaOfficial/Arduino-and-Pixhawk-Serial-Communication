# Arduino-and-Pixhawk-Serial-Communication

## Overview
This example demonstrates how to establish serial communication between an Arduino board and a Pixhawk flight controller using the PX4 firmware. It provides code that allows you to send messages from Arduino to Pixhawk and receive messages from Pixhawk on Arduino.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board
- Pixhawk flight controller
- Serial cable for connecting Arduino and Pixhawk

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE ([Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- PX4 firmware ([Download](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/getting_started))

## Instructions

### 1. Hardware Connection
- Connect the Arduino board to the Pixhawk flight controller using a serial cable.
- Make sure the correct pins (usually TX and RX) are connected between the devices.

### 2. Software Setup
- Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already.
- Install the PX4 firmware on the Pixhawk flight controller following the instructions provided in the PX4 documentation.

### 3. Arduino Code Setup
- Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
- Copy and paste the code from the provided example into the sketch.
- If necessary, modify the code to match the correct serial port pins and baud rates for your specific setup.

### 4. Upload the Arduino Code
- Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.
- Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
- Click on the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino.

### 5. Test the Communication
- Open the Arduino Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
- Make sure the baud rate in the Serial Monitor matches the baud rate set in the Arduino code.
- Reset the Pixhawk flight controller to start the communication.
- You should see the test message being sent from Arduino to Pixhawk and the received message being printed in the Serial Monitor.

## Additional Considerations
- Make sure the baud rate setting in both the Arduino code and the Pixhawk firmware matches.
- Understand the communication protocol and message format used by the Pixhawk or PX4 firmware to properly interpret received messages.
- Implement error handling mechanisms, such as checksums or acknowledgments, to ensure reliable communication.
- Consider using interrupts or accurate timing if working with real-time or time-critical applications.
- Debug and troubleshoot any issues by utilizing tools like the Arduino Serial Monitor or debugging output.
